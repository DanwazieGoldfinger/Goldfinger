Git is a program that tracks changes made to files. The purpose of Git is to help a software developer manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. When Git is installed, it can be initialized on a project to create a repository otherwise called repo.

The git repository is a virtual storage of git projects which allows the user to save versions of his codes and it can be accessed when needed.

One git technique is cloning. Cloning is a git technique that allows a user to work on a copy of his repository without any interference from other changes made. This is very useful when working as a team. This happens as a result of the user having cloned the codebase of an existing project into his local system.
